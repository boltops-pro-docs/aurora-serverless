This blueprint provisions a RDS Aurora Serverless Database Cluster.

* AutoScaling settings are configured with Parameters.
* Storage is encrypted by default.
* A managed DB Subnet Group can be created by configuring `SubnetIds`. Or you can use an existing `DBSubnetGroupName`.
* Can create an optional managed Route53 records that point to the cluster endpoint.
* Cluster Parameters can be configured with code.
* For a standard RDS Database, refer to the [RDS Blueprint](https://github.com/boltopspro-docs/rds). You might also be interested in the [aurora](https://github.com/boltopspro-docs/aurora) blueprint.

## Usage

1. Add blueprint to Gemfile
2. Configure: configs/aurora-serverless values
3. Deploy blueprint

## Add

Add the blueprint to your lono project's `Gemfile`.

```ruby
gem "aurora-serverless", git: "git@github.com:boltopspro/aurora-serverless.git"
```

## Configure

Use the [lono seed](https://lono.cloud/reference/lono-seed/) command to generate a starter config params files.

    LONO_ENV=development lono seed aurora-serverless
    LONO_ENV=production  lono seed aurora-serverless

The files in `config/aurora-serverless` folder will look something like this:

    configs/aurora-serverless/
    ├── params
    │   ├── development.txt
    │   └── production.txt
    └── variables
        ├── development.rb
        └── production.rb

Configure the `configs/aurora-serverless/params` and `configs/aurora-serverless/variables` files.  The parameters required: `MasterUsername`, `MasterUserPassword`, and `VpcId`.  Example:

configs/aurora-serverless/params/development.txt:

    MasterUsername=myuser
    MasterUserPassword=mypassword
    VpcId=vpc-111

## Deploy

Use the [lono cfn deploy](http://lono.cloud/reference/lono-cfn-deploy/) command to deploy.

    LONO_ENV=development lono cfn deploy aurora-serverless --sure --no-wait
    LONO_ENV=production  lono cfn deploy aurora-serverless --sure --no-wait

It takes about 15m to deploy the aurora-serverless DB instance. Times may vary.

If you are using One AWS Account, use these commands instead: [One Account](docs/one-account.md).

## Configure: More Details

### Compatible Parameters and Variables

The `Engine`, `EngineVersion`, `ClusterParameterGroupFamily`, `DBInstanceClass` parameters must be a valid combination.

A managed DB Parameter Group is also created based on the `ClusterParameterGroupFamily` parameter and `@cluster_parameter_group_parameters` variable. `@cluster_parameter_group_parameters` must contain at least 1 parameter value. Here's a table with tested example values:

Engine | EngineVersion | ClusterParameterGroupFamily | DBInstanceClass | parameter example
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
aurora | 5.6.10a | aurora5.6 | db.t3.small | time_zone=US/Pacific

Each particular database engine is different and has its own configuration values. Refer to each databases's docs to find out what you can set. Here are some useful docs:

* [Database Engine Versions for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Updates.20180305.html)
* [How do I change the time zone of my Amazon RDS DB instance?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/rds-change-time-zone/)
* [Choosing the DB Instance Class](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html)

### AutoScaling Settings

You can also configure the `ScalingConfiguration` with parameters. Example:

configs/aurora-serverless/params/development.txt:

    AutoPause=true
    MaxCapacity=16
    MinCapacity=2
    SecondsUntilAutoPause=300

### Using a Custom VPC

You must also provide either `DBSubnetGroupName` or `SubnetIds`. Only provide only one, not both.

By Providing the `SubnetIds` parameter only the blueprint will create a managed [AWS::RDS::DBSubnetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbsubnet-group.html) resource in the same custom VPC. Example:

    VpcId=vpc-111
    SubnetIds=subnet-111,subnet-222

### Private Data Subnet

It is recommended to run the database in a private data subnet. The [reference-architecture](https://github.com/boltopspro-docs/reference-architecture) [vpc](https://github.com/boltopspro-docs/vpc) blueprint is has a `PrivateDBSubnetGroup` db subnet group contains the private subnets.  A quick way to get the VPC and subnet values is from the VPC CloudFormation Outputs. Here's an example of the development VPC.

![](https://img.boltops.com/boltopspro/blueprints/vpc/dev-vpc-outputs.png)

If you are not using the reference architecture and you do not have a Db Subnet Group, specifying `SubnetIds` will create a [AWS::RDS::DBSubnetGroup
](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbsubnet-group.html) for you.

### Security Groups

To assign existing security groups to the RDS database use `VpcSecurityGroupIds`. Example:

    VpcSecurityGroupIds=sg-111,sg-222

If not set, then the blueprint will create and a managed Security Group and assign it to the RDS database.

### Route53 DNS Pretty Host Name

It is recommended to use a Private HostedZone to create a pretty endpoint for the DBCluster Endpoint.  Example:

    DnsName=dbcluster.private.
    HostedZoneName=private.

### Advanced Properties Customizations

Several [AWS::RDS::DBCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-rds-dbcluster.html) properties are configurable with [Parameters](https://lono.cloud/docs/configs/params/). Properties that are not configurable with Parameters are configured with [Variables](https://lono.cloud/docs/configs/shared-variables/).  The `@cluster_properties` variable allows you to override any property.  Example:

```ruby
@cluster_properties = {
  port: 3306,
  character_set_name: "utf8_unicode_ci",
}
```

The blueprint is written so that Variables take higher precedence than Parameters.

## Considerations

Using CloudFormation to provision RDS databases has some pros and cons.

* The main pro is that the infrastructure is codified and reproducible.
* The main con is that CloudFormation can **replace** your database entirely, and you'll lose your data!

Depending on the [AWS::RDS::Instance property](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-rds-database-instance.html) property that is changed, CloudFormation **replaces** the database entirely. You have to look for "Update requires: Replacement". This is dangerously easy to forget.

An excellent way to provide a guard rail against accidental replacement is to set the `DBClusterIdentifier` parameter. If you change any property that requires replacement, then the CloudFormation stack update will immediately fail, because RDS won't be able to create another database with the same `DBClusterIdentifier`.

Another technique you can use to prevent an accidental replacement is only to use CloudFormation for the initial provisioning of the database. Afterward, you'll modify the RDS DB with the API or Console only. Yet another way to provide a guard rail is to enable `DeletionProtection=true`. This prevents the current database from being deleted. However, it deletion happens as part of the CloudFormation cleanup step, so it takes longer for the rollback to finish.
